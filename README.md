# Realogix-Intelligent-Real-Estate-Logistics-Platform
 Welcome to our **Realogix-Intelligent-Real-Estate-Logistics-Platform** project! We are delving into the complexities of real estate pricing, aiming to make this intricate market more accessible to buyers, sellers, and enthusiasts alike. This journey uses **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks** to analyze a real estate dataset and apply various classification algorithms to predict pricing tiers accurately.

---

## **Project Overview**

The real estate market is a tapestry woven from various factors â€” location, property features, economic conditions, and more. Our mission is to unravel this complexity by creating a model that classifies properties into distinct pricing tiers. This tool empowers decision-making, offering insights that pave the way for a deeper understanding of the market.

Our data is sourced from Kaggle's [USA Real Estate Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset/data?select=realtor-data.zip.csv), offering a comprehensive view of the current real estate landscape.

## **Classification Criteria for Residential Properties**

We classify properties into the following pricing tiers:

1. **Starter Homes (Tier 1)**:  
   Priced below $300,000, these affordable options are ideal for first-time buyers or those on a budget.  
   *Examples*: Entry-level homes in suburban areas.

2. **Family-Friendly Homes (Tier 2)**:  
   Priced between $300,001 and $500,000, offering space and amenities for families.  
   *Examples*: Single-family homes, townhouses, or condos with multiple bedrooms.

3. **Executive Properties (Tier 3)**:  
   Priced between $500,001 and $1,000,000, featuring modern amenities and urban convenience.  
   *Examples*: Upscale homes and luxury townhouses in desirable neighborhoods.

4. **Luxury Estates (Tier 4)**:  
   Priced above $1,000,000, these properties offer expansive living spaces and premium features.  
   *Examples*: High-end homes with private gyms, swimming pools, and exclusive locations.
